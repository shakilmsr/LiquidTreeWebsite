# Liquid Tree Project

Innovating IoT-Based Smart Liquid Trees for Carbon Footprint Mitigation in Dense Urban Areas of Bangladesh
Project Overview

This project aims to develop a fully functional prototype of a "Liquid Tree Unit" to address urban air pollution in densely populated areas of Bangladesh.  The Liquid Tree is an innovative bioreactor designed to absorb CO2 and release oxygen, similar to conventional trees, but in a concentrated and compact form.  This makes it suitable for deployment in urban locations with limited green space, such as sidewalks, road medians, and building facades.
